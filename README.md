# Full-State Feedback Control Design via Pole Placement

## Project Overview
This repository demonstrates the application of full-state feedback control using pole placement for smoothly landing a drone. The primary objective is to design a control system that allows for stable and controlled descent, by carefully selecting five poles to achieve the desired system dynamics. The entire design and simulation process is implemented using MATLAB Live Scripts.

### Key Features
- **Drone Control**: Designing a control system focused on the smooth and stable landing of a drone.
- **Pole Placement Strategy**: Utilization of pole placement techniques to influence the system's dynamics and stability.
- **MATLAB Live Script Implementation**: Leveraging MATLAB's Live Script for interactive coding, data visualization, and documentation.
